# ChatBox
Bare bones, simple ,elegant and very small chatbox server based in NodeJS.

## How to run this server?
Paste this into your terminal.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/erucix/ChatBox.git
cd ChatBox
node server.js
```
Now your server is up and listening at port `8888`. Visit ```localhost:8888``` from your browser.

## Features:
- Saves  chat automatically
- No security implemented
- Supports nickname and avatar
- Supports custom cammands like in discord

**Note**: This server implementation has no security features implemented. SO XSS,DDoS are very much possible. Proceed with caution before implementing this into real world.
